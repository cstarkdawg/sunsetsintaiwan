        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>I'm a big fan of Taipei’s riverside parks, and one of the best places to witness a stunning sunset is Sunset Spot Title. Situated at the crossroads of Zhongshan, Neihu, and Songshan, Sunset Spot Title is a vast park that offers ample space for various activities.</p>

        <h2>Activities at Sunset Spot Title:</h2>
        <p>I’m a big fan of Taipei’s riverside parks. One of the best of these in which to see a sunset is Meiti. Situated at the crossroads of Zhongshan, Neihu, and Songshan, Meiti is a huge park offering plenty of space for many activities. At Meiti, you’ll find people playing sports, picnicking, running, walking their dogs, and biking. From the park, you can see planes landing at Songshan Airport, traffic jams on the highway, Taipei 101 towering over the city, flowers blooming, boats floating on the river, and the majestic Grand Hotel Taipei behind the beautiful Dazhi Bridge. All of these sights together provide a huge variety of options when it comes to taking sunset pictures.</p>

        <h2>Sunset Photography:</h2>
        <p>You can walk right next to the river and take nice pictures with the bridge and Grand Hotel in the background, the approximate direction the sun will be setting. You can also utilize some of the park’s many trees as a foreground reference point. Some creative folks might like taking pictures from behind the basketball court to capture some action during the sunset. What I enjoy about the park is that it’s so big, and you’re not stuck at only one good spot.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
        <p>If you don’t live near Neihu, Meiti Riverside Park probably takes a bit of time to get to. If you want to stick to public transit and don’t mind walking, take the MRT to Jiannan Road Station and walk about 15 minutes to the park. That same MRT station has YouBikes, which I recommend as they’ll get you to the park quickly, and you’ll have a way to move around inside the huge park a lot easier. You can also take a bus to the park. From MRT Jiannan Road Station, you can take the R3 Shuttle to the entrance (the Dazhi Meiti Garden 3 stop). Multiple buses (including the 42 from Taipei Main Station) stop at Dazhi Meiti Garden 2. Finally, there are plenty of scooter and car parking spots in the park.</p>
